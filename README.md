Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to analyze large datasets, find patterns, and make informed decisions or predictions, and its performance improves as it is exposed to more data. Examples include fraud detection, personalized recommendations, and image recognition.
